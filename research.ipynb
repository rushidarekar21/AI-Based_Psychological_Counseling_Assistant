You can find interesting opportunities to take online courses from universities all over the world through MOOCs and other online learning platforms, you can learn a new language online or through apps, and you can learn new hobbies and activities.

      "content=\"It's completely normal to feel anxious when faced with public speaking. Many people experience anxiety in high-pressure situations like this, and it's not necessarily something to be ashamed of. \\n\\nOne helpful approach when dealing with public speaking anxiety is to focus on distractions. Instead of ruminating on your anxiety or worrying about what others might think, try to focus on what you're doing or saying. This can help take your mind off your anxiety and distract you from it. For example, you can think about the content of your presentation, practice what you're going to say, or focus on the audience you're speaking to.\\n\\nTo get even more comfortable, consider building your confidence by taking small steps. Begin by practicing public speaking in low-stakes situations, like speaking up in a small meeting or presenting an idea to a friend or family member. As you become more confident, you can gradually move on to more significant public speaking situations.\\n\\nIt's also helpful to remember that everyone gets nervous sometimes, even experienced public speakers. Your anxiety doesn't define your speakership; it's a normal part of the process, and it's not a reflection of your ability to communicate effectively.\\n\\nLastly, practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or visualization, to help calm your nerves before a public speech. You can also develop a pre-speaking ritual to help you feel more confident and centered.\\n\\nIt might be helpful to talk to someone you trust about your anxiety, whether it's a friend, family member, or mental health professional. They can offer support, provide valuable advice, or even help you learn more relaxation techniques or coping strategies.\\n\\nKeep in mind that it's okay to take your time and work at your own pace. You can't just wave the anxiety away, but you can learn to manage it, and with time and practice, you can become a confident and capable public speaker.\\n\\nWould you like to talk more about this?\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 383, 'prompt_tokens': 768, 'total_tokens': 1151, 'completion_time': 0.510666667, 'prompt_time': 0.024311226, 'queue_time': 0.237039737, 'total_time': 0.534977893}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_21a77a6a8c', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-722e4336-b23b-44ce-9649-f28aab0bc505-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 768, 'output_tokens': 383, 'total_tokens': 1151}\n"
